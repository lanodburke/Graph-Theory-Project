# Graph-Theory-Project

Go program to build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression and check a input string given by the user to check if it matches the NFA. This project is a college project for the Graph Theory module in GMIT.

## Research and Development


## Getting Started

To run the program first you will need to clone this repository onto your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/lanodburke/Graph-Theory-Project.git
```
Change directory into the Graph-Theory-Project folder.
```
cd Graph-Theory-Project
```
Then you will need to build the project by using the following command.
```
go build main.go
```
To run the program on Windows type this command into the command line.
```
main.exe
```
On macOS run this command.
```
./main
```

## Prerequisites

To run this program you will need to have Go installed on your machine, if you do not have it installed there is a detailed run through on how to install and setup go on your machine found [here](https://golang.org/doc/install)
